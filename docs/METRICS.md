# Open Match 2 Telemetry

Open Match 2 uses OpenTelemetry to emit detailed metrics on core operations, RPC calls, and cache performance, providing deep visibility into the matchmaking process.  Some of the provided metrics are provided out-of-the-box by golang modules om-core imports, and aren't covered in this document (i.e. rpc, etc).  We recommend you use OpenTelemetry to emit telemetry from the matchmaker you write against Open Match 2 as well \- for some examples of matchmaker telemetry, have a look at the [example in the open-match-ecosystem repository](https://github.com/googleforgames/open-match-ecosystem/tree/main/v2/METRICS.md).

### **Enabling and Configuring OpenTelemetry for Open Match 2**

To enable OpenTelemetry in Open Match 2, you need to set the `OM_OTEL_SIDECAR` environment variable to `true`. By default, Open Match will try to export metrics to a local OpenTelemetry sidecar. If you are running without a sidecar, you can set `OM_OTEL_SIDECAR` to `false` (for example, in local development).

You can configure the OpenTelemetry exporter by setting the appropriate environment variables. For more information, please refer to the OpenTelemetry documentation.

### **Core Metrics**

These metrics are defined in `metrics.go` and provide insights into the overall health and performance of the Open Match service.

| `om_core.cache.tickets.available` | Number of active tickets in the cache at the time the InvokeMatchmakingFunctions() call processed pool filters for the provided profile. | count |
| `om_core.profile.pools` | Number of pools in the profile provided to the InvokeMatchmakingFunctions() call. | count |
| `om_core.mmf.failures` | Number of MMF failures. | count |
| `om_core.mmf.deactivations` | Number of deactivations due to tickets being returned in matches by MMFs. | count |

| `om_core.mmf.deactivation.wait` | Time spent waiting for match ticket deactivations to replicate to the local cache. | ms |
| `om_core.mmf.deactivation.timeouts` | Number of times waiting for match ticket deactivations to replicate to the local cache timed out. | count |
| `om_core.match.received` | Total matches received from MMFs. | count |

### **Cache Metrics**

These metrics are defined in `internal/statestore/cache/metrics.go` and provide insights into the performance of the replicated ticket cache.

| Metric Name | Description | Unit |

| `om_core.cache.assignment.expirations` | Number of assignments expired per cache expiration cycle. | count |
| `om_core.cache.outgoing.updates` | Number of outgoing replication updates per cycle. | count |
| `om_core.cache.ticket.expirations` | Number of tickets expired per cache expiration cycle. | count |
| `om_core.cache.incoming.updates` | Number of incoming replication updates per poll. | count |
| `om_core.cache.ticket.inactive.expirations` | Number of inactive tickets expired per cache expiration cycle. | count |
| `om_core.cache.outgoing.timeouts` | Number of times the outgoing replication queue waited OM\_CACHE\_OUT\_WAIT\_TIMEOUT\_MS and did not reach OM\_CACHE\_OUT\_MAX\_QUEUE\_THRESHOLD updates to send as a batch to the replicator. | count |
| `om_core.cache.outgoing.maxqueuethresholdreached` | Number of times the outgoing replication queue saw OM\_CACHE\_OUT\_MAX\_QUEUE\_THRESHOLD updates in less than OM\_CACHE\_OUT\_WAIT\_TIMEOUT\_MS milliseconds. | count |
| `om_core.cache.outgoing.queue.wait` | Time an outgoing replication update spends queued and being sent before returning a response. | ms |
| `om_core.cache.outgoing.send.duration` | Duration of sending a batch of outgoing replication updates to state storage. | ms |
| `om_core.cache.incoming.timeouts.empty` | Number of times the incoming replication queue saw no updates after waiting for OM\_CACHE\_IN\_WAIT\_TIMEOUT\_MS. | count |
| `om_core.cache.incoming.timeouts.full` | Number of times the incoming replication queue couldn't process all pending updates in OM\_CACHE\_IN\_MAX\_APPLY\_DURATION\_MS. | count |
| `om_core.cache.incoming.polls.full` | Number of times an incoming replication poll returned the maximum OM\_CACHE\_IN\_MAX\_UPDATES\_PER\_POLL updates. | count |
| `om_core.cache.incoming.poll.duration` | Duration of polling state storage for incoming replication updates. | ms |
| `om_core.cache.incoming.poll.wait` | Post-poll pause before the next incoming replication poll (OM\_CACHE\_IN\_POLL\_WAIT\_MS after a partial poll, OM\_CACHE\_IN\_FULL\_POLL\_WAIT\_MS after a full poll, or any remaining OM\_CACHE\_IN\_WAIT\_TIMEOUT\_MS if an empty poll returned early on error). | ms |
